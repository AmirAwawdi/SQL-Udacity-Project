# SQL-Udacity-Project
Deforestation Exploration - Udacity project;  Data analysis report with SQL.


### Project Overveiw

ForestQuery, a non-profit organization, on a mission to reduce deforestation around the world by raising awareness about this important critical environmental issue.

The executive director and her leadership team members are intrested in understanding which countries and regions around the world seem to have forests that have been shrinking in size, and which countries and regions have the most significant forest area, both in terms of amount and percent of total area. The hope is that these findings can help inform initiatives, communications, and personnel allocation to achieve the largest impact with the precious few resources that the organization has at its disposal.

This map visually represents the net change in forest cover worldwide. Green indicates countries experiencing positive changes, regrowing forests faster than they are losing them, while red represents countries with negative changes, losing more forest than they are able to restore.

![alt text](https://github.com/AmirAwawdi/SQL-Udacity-Project/blob/main/DB%20ERD.png?raw=true)

that you’d like to query to answer some of the most important questions in preparation for a meeting with the ForestQuery executive team coming up in a few days. Ahead of the meeting, you’d like to prepare and disseminate a report for the leadership team that uses complete sentences to help them understand the global deforestation overview between 1990 and 2016.

You will be creating a report for the executive team in which you explain your results using complete sentences.

Report Sections
The report has five sections that you will need to complete:
