#  Deforestation Exploration
Udacity SQL project - Data analysis report.


## Project Overveiw

ForestQuery, a non-profit organization, on a mission to reduce deforestation around the world by raising awareness about this important critical environmental issue.

The executive director and her leadership team members are intrested in understanding which countries and regions around the world seem to have forests that have been shrinking in size, and which countries and regions have the most significant forest area, both in terms of amount and percent of total area. The hope is that these findings can help inform initiatives, communications, and personnel allocation to achieve the largest impact with the precious few resources that the organization has at its disposal.

This map visually represents the net change in forest cover worldwide. Green indicates countries experiencing positive changes, regrowing forests faster than they are losing them, while red represents countries with negative changes, losing more forest than they are able to restore.

## Project Instructions

As a data analyst, I'm utilizing updated tables of online data dealing with forestation as well as total land area and region groupings, which I have brought together into a database described by the following ERD:

I'm querying it to address the key questions posed by the ForestQuery executive team by providing valuable insights and observations on global deforestation trends from 1990 to 2016. The project outcome is a comprehensive report that summarizes the findings and helps the leadership team understand the global deforestation situation.

### Report Sections:

#### 1. Global Situation: 
This section provides an overview of the global deforestation scenario during the specified period. It highlights key statistics, trends, and patterns observed on a global scale.

#### 2. Regional Outlook: 
In this section, we delve into the regional perspective of deforestation. It analyzes deforestation trends and patterns across different regions, identifying areas of concern and highlighting regions with significant changes in forest cover.

#### 3. Drill down on Country-Level Details: 
Here, we zoom in further to examine deforestation at the country level. This section provides detailed insights into specific countries, including their respective deforestation rates, major drivers, and notable observations.

#### 4. Analytical Recommendations: 
This section offers analytical recommendations based on the insights gained from the data analysis. It presents suggestions and strategies for mitigating deforestation, preserving forest ecosystems, and promoting sustainable practices.

#### 5. Appendix: 
SQL Queries Used: The appendix section includes a collection of SQL queries used throughout the project. This transparency allows readers to replicate the analysis and explore the data further.

By synthesizing the information collected and applying analytical techniques, this report aims to equip the ForestQuery leadership team with a comprehensive understanding of the global deforestation overview. The insights provided can aid in informed decision-making and the formulation of effective strategies to address deforestation challenges.
