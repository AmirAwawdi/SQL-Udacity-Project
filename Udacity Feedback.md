## Udacity Reviewer Notes

This is quite a good piece of work and the effort and time invested into this work are very evident in the strength of the work.

### Building A View

1. Greatly done! The answer mentioned in the report (Peru) is correct and testing your queries gives the expected results :tada:
It was quite a great demonstration of the Create View concept that joins the three required columns of forest_area, land_area, 
and regions to produce a single view, setting the pace for the rest of the work to be done on our dataset for this work.
The create a forestation view query that the student writes prior to answering the questions joins all three tables on the columns indicated, 
and creates a new column by performing a calculation that compares two columns.

### Basic SQL Queries

1. Your SELECT queries are good and display the required outputs required :clap::clap:
SELECT queries return results consistent with the question being asked.

2. WHERE clauses used in SELECT statements filter tables according to the questions being asked.

3. Operators such as Boolean and conditional operators are greatly used in the queries and the queries demonstrate a solid mastery of this. Keep the good work coming :star:
GROUP BY clauses aggregate results by chosen categorical variables.

4. It was a good piece of work here in including your queries in the appendix section of this submission.
The queries execute giving the correct output :tada:
Each query is included in the Appendix and executes properly. A reviewer should be able to execute this same query and get the correct output.

5. Great demonstration of ORDER By in your SELECT statements. ORDER BY is used to specify a pattern or hierarchy in which the results of a query should be presented.
ORDER BY clauses used in SELECT statements sort query results according to the questions being asked, and specify ASC for ascending or DESC for descending where appropriate.

6. Queries make use of operators such as =, < and/or > to qualify WHERE clauses and JOIN statements, as well as conditions AND and OR to link conditional clauses.


### Join Command

1. Queries include Join clauses that match appropriate columns together using the ON command and the appropriate Boolean operator.
2. The student creates a query that joins a table to itself in order to compare values in two different rows.
3. There is a smart use of the JOIN command in your queries :clap::clap: 
However, it is good practice to always differentiate within the different kinds of JOINs when we make use of them.
Queries include the appropriate form of Join (Inner, Left, Right, Outer) clause to ensure that no necessary rows are left out.

### Case Command
1. Good job !
The query the student writes for question 3(c) includes a CASE statement that addresses the question.

### Report Formatting
1. All queries captured in the Appendix follow SQL formatting guidelines, including those for indentation, capitalization.
2. All queries are properly formatted using best practices syntax
3. All queries run without errors
4. The report is good, capturing all the required 5 main points. :star:
